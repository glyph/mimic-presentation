          <aside class="notes">
            Lekha: Today we are going to talk about Mimic - an opensource
            framework that allows for testing against for OpenStack and
            Rackspace APIs, how it is making testing for products in Rackspace
            a cake walk and how it could potentially do the same for your
            OpenStack-backed applications. Your contributions, will help us get
            there.

          <h1>Autoscale</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            Rackspace Autoscale is a system which automates the process of
            getting the right amount of compute capacity for an application, by
            creating (scaling up) and deleting (scaling down) servers and
            associating them with load balancers.

            In order to perform this task, Autoscale speaks to three back-end
            APIs: Rackspace Identity for authentication and impersonation,
            Rackspace Cloud Servers for provisioning and deleting servers, and
            Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers for adding and removing servers to
            load balancers as they are created and deleted.

            Rackspace Identity is API-compatible with OpenStack Identity v2,
            Rackspace Cloud Servers is powered by and API-compatible with
            OpenStack Compute, although Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers is a
            custom API.

            As you can see here, it is only a 3 step process to get mimic
            started, and be able to hit the APIs it implements.  The steps are
            pip install mimic, run mimic and hit the endpoint! That's it.  As
            we mentioned, the way you hit the endpoint is to simply change your
            client's Identity URL to Mimic's and run your code as before.
