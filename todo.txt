    - system integration test slides

        - "example 1" / "example 2" -> better words

    - testing / types of testing slides

        - merge into one slide

    - "testing problems" / "more problems"

        - one slide per problem; say what the problem is specifically on the slide

    - plugin section

        - slides for "Entry" / "Endpoint" so it's clear what these data structures are

        - slide for URL structure so that it's clearer what "return a resource"
          means, since these kids today don't even know what a PROPFIND on an
          entity collection is

        - word wrap / hyphenation on 'entry'

        - much better outro transition

    - demos

        - slow down a little bit, especially the error injection one

        - autoplay video on speaker notes as well, hopefully times will
          synchronize relatively closely so we can see them playing together

    - visuals

        - increase the size of code samples, images, and videos in the CSS
          (especially videos)

    - general->specific / specific->general

        - call out what "general" refers to (mocking, testing for failure) and
          what "specific" refers to (mimic itself, autoscale)

    - error repository slides

        - what errors are currently present (talk about presets & preset API
          endpoint, maybe?)

        - what is the plan for the future for making the repository of response
          types more discoverable?

    - time control

        - JSON response looks unintentionally truncated
            - 2 space indents so timestamp fits
            - "..." instead of randomly cutting off

        - highlight relevant / important areas
